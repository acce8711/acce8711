# Hello! I am [Amina](https://aminaal-helali.netlify.app/)

## About me...
I'm a 4th year Information Technology student in the Interactive Multimedia & Design program. While my background is mainly in software development ðŸ’», I enjoy working across the full product journey from designing user experiences ðŸŽ¨ to building them. Accessibility is a key focus in my projects to keep things simple and usable for everyone. I'm looking for opportunities within **software development**, **VR** and **museum space**.
